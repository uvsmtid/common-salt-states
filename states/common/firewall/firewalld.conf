# firewalld config file

# default zone
# The default zone used if an empty zone string is used.
# Default: public

# Change default to trusted: this firewall is about NAT not about restrictions.
DefaultZone=trusted

# Minimal mark
# Marks up to this minimum are free for use for example in the direct
# interface. If more free marks are needed, increase the minimum
# Default: 100
MinimalMark=100

# Clean up on exit
# If set to no or false the firewall configuration will not get cleaned up
# on exit or stop of firewalld
# Default: yes
CleanupOnExit=yes

# Lockdown
# If set to enabled, firewall changes with the D-Bus interface will be limited
# to applications that are listed in the lockdown whitelist.
# The lockdown whitelist file is lockdown-whitelist.xml
# Default: no
Lockdown=no

# IPv6_rpfilter
# Performs a reverse path filter test on a packet for IPv6. If a reply to the
# packet would be sent via the same interface that the packet arrived on, the
# packet will match and be accepted, otherwise dropped.
# The rp_filter for IPv4 is controlled using sysctl.
# Default: yes
#
# NOTE: At the moment this option (and some others) has to be explicitly
#       set to something valid.
#       See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1239326
IPv6_rpfilter=yes
