# These variables are fed into Jinja templates of pillars -
# they simply parameterize pillars.
#
# In addition to parameterization of pillars, properties can also
# be accessed themselves under root of `pillar` dict in state template files.

# USECASE 1: Initial Salt master setup
#
# See `states/bootstrap/bootstrap.dir/configure_salt.py` script.
# This script is able to configure Salt with single master minion
# using ONLY this property file as parameter.
#
# USECASE 2: frequently changed conditions affecting multiple pillars
#
# In this case properties are simply set of parameters which are supposed
# to be changed more frequently than other content in pillar files.
# For example, if Salt configures laptop which is often switched between
# proxied and direct Internet networking, properties provide single variable
# (see `use)internet_http_proxy` below) which affects all relevant pillars
# to reconfigure system for required networking conditions.
#

# Use generic profile (saved in project's `states` repository).
# NOTE: This is only for convenience of development when both states
#       and pillars (template pillars) are changed in the same
#       `states` repository.
# NOTE: None of the `pillars` repositories is considered
#       when generic profile from `states` repository is used.
#       Normally profile is not generic, and this value is set to `False`.
