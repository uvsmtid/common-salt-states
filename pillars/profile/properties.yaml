# USECASE 2: frequently changed conditions affecting multiple pillars
#
# In this case properties are simply set of parameters which are supposed
# to be changed more frequently than other content in pillar files.
# For example, if Salt configures laptop which is often switched between
# proxied and direct Internet networking, properties provide single variable
# (see `use)internet_http_proxy` below) which affects all relevant pillars
# to reconfigure system for required networking conditions.
