* TODO: There should be a more generic user accounts configuration.
  Instead of specifying only `primary_username` under each host in
  `system_hosts`, use account assignments to hosts (similar to
  role assignments in `system_host_roles`).
  This approach should also be integrated with SSH key distribution to
  use more than one possible SSH public/private key pairs.
