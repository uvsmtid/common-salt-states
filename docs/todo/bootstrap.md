* TODO: Document all steps of `deploy` action (i.e. `make_salt_resolvable`,
  or `init_dns_server`) for [boostrap][1] and their configuration
  parameters in files under `conf`.
* TODO: Write doc for command line parameters to bootstrap script itself (how
  to run installer).

* Note that location of the pillar is _assumed_.
  TODO: Make location of the pillar declared, otherwise if pillar is
        located in different place, rewrite will be merge with
        unpredictable results.
