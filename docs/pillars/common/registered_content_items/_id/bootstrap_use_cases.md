At the moment the value of `bootstrap_use_cases` key is boolean:
* `True` - include content item to bootstrap package.
* `False` - exclude content item to bootstrap package.

TODO:
The feature can be extended to specify list of bootstrap use cases.
This will make content of bootstrap packages tailored to specific use case
(which makes such content not universal) but reduce their size.
