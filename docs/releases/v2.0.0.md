TODO: This is a draft release notes for `v2.0.0`.

## `vX.-.-` = major (backwards-incompatible) changes ##

*   Rename host roles for clarity:

    *   `resolver_role` => `hostname_resolver_role`

    *   `sonar_qube_role` => `sonarqube_server_role`

    *   `router_role` => `network_router_role

    *   `hypervisor_role` => `virtual_machine_hypervisor_role`

    *   `controller_role` => `salt_master_role`

*   There is no more
    `common.orchestrate.wraps.main` and `common.orchestrate.wraps.primary`
    states.

    Instead, new `salt_minion_role` host role was added which handles
    general (use to be `main`) and minimal (used to be `primary`)
    minion configuration.

## `v-.Y.-` = minor (backwards-compatible) changes ##

*   Added new host roles:

    *   `salt_minion_role` to handle configuration for all minions.

        Whether minion is assigned to the `salt_minion_role` role
        or not is controlled by [minions_list.yaml][1] file.

## `v-.-.Z` = bugfixes ##

TODO
