Release `v1.0.0` follows the [baseline release][1] more than a year after
with multiple bug fixes and features - only key changes can be mentioned:

*   Added support for "defaults" and "overrides" Salt pillars.

*   Local offline YUM repository support.

*   Various continuous integration platform improvements tested in operations.

    These changes are the main bulk of completed work with the design of
    the build pipeline, all added jobs, fixes due to bugs detected.

    In particular, the build cycle was made complete with Vagrant boxes
    being destroyed and re-instantiated from scratch. This was tested
    with `rhel5` and `rhel7` OSes.

*   Various bootstrap package improvements tested in operations.

    Current bootstrapped Salt version is `2010.5.10`.

*   Added script `configure_salt.py` to automatically configure Salt master.

*   Added Maven artifacts verificiation facilities.

*   Network configuration was made sane enough to be used in operations.

*   Initial support for account configuration in `system_accounts` pillar key.

*   Initial support for secred data in `system_secrets` pillar key.
